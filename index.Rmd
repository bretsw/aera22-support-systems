# Disruptions

# COVID-19 Response

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/mask.jpg")
```

--

Take a moment to think back on the disruptions of the past couple of years:

--

- How did you respond? How are you responding?

--

- What help did you need to move forward?

---

# Gaps in Disruption Response

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

--

There were gaps in the pandemic response for all of us.

--

Formal, official help wasn't enough.

--

It was up to you to figure out how to fill the gaps.

# The Study

---

# Purpose

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teacher.jpg")
```

Explore **support systems** 

--

that early career teachers construct 

--

during **induction** - the disrupted transition period from preparation to practice

---

# Participants

```{r, out.width = "280px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teaching.jpg")
```

--

I wanted to understand how early career teachers expand **induction support systems** of tools, people, and spaces with social media.

--

so I talked to them (semi-structured interviews):

--

- College of Education Master's degree students (*n* = 9)

--

- 0-3 years experience in teaching

--

- Teaching in U.S. (geographically dispersed)

--

- Distinct backgrounds and experiences: classroom teachers, specialists, itinerants, starting mid-year

# Discussion

# Enactment of Identity-Agency

```{r, out.width = "600", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

--

- All interviewees enacted identity-agency.

--

- That is, they took responsibility for and actively investing in their own self-development as a teacher (Ruohotie-Lyhty & Moate, 2016).  

---

# Enactment of Identity-Agency

```{r, out.width = "600", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

- They consistently described a purposeful sense of having a job to do and a determination to find the tools, people, and spaces necessary to do that job well.

--

- They also exercised agency when they chose not to pursue some of the opportunities available to them.

# Implications

# Implications for Early Career Ts

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

--

- Experienced **context collapse**

--

- Struggled with **social comparison**: feeling like a crappy teacher

---

# Implications for Early Career Ts

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

**Desire to be free from scrutiny:**

--

- Become less active on social media

--

- Choose more private spaces (e.g., school- or district-sponsored LMS shells)

---

# Implications for Ed Leaders

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

**Aim to sustain early career teachers, not just retain them.**

--

- Expand notions of what "counts" for professional development to include social media: alleviates some tensions around **time**

--

- Set up protected spaces for early career teachers and train them to use: alleviates some tensions around **context collapse** and **social comparison**

---

# Conclusion

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/support-system-wide.jpg")
```

--

- Social media continue to expand the number of available tools, people, and spaces

--

- Early career teachers, teacher educators, and education leaders must likewise continue to expand their understanding of self-directed support systems

---

# Conclusion

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/support-system-wide.jpg")
```

- Agency is finite:

--

  - Early career teachers often take initiative to expand induction support systems,

--

  - but if their agency is fully spent, they may still find they have little choice but to leave the profession.
